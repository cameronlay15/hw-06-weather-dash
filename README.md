# hw-06-weather-dash
This project we were tasked with completeing a weather dashboard. The idea is to create a dashboard that displays a temperature, humidity, wind speedm u-v index, and 5-day forecast based on a location search by the uder.
# Installation

I pulled the png files from Github from the gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020 repo. The remainder of the formatting was from Boot Strap, javaScript, and jQuery. The weather was references using the operweathermap api (see below).

# Usage
This dashboard could be used daily to see the daily weather as well as the weather for the week.
